Minimal [Cookiecutter] template for authoring [pytest] plugins that help
you to write better programs.

> This template requires [Cookiecutter 1.4.0 "Shortbread"][Shortbread] or
> higher

## Getting Started

Install [Cookiecutter] and generate a new pytest plugin project:

```no-highlight
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin
```

Cookiecutter prompts you for information regarding your plugin:

```no-highlight
full_name [Raphael Pierzina]: Andreas Pelme
email [raphael@hackebrot.de]: andreas@pelme.se
github_username [hackebrot]: pelme
plugin_name [foobar]: awesome
module_name [awesome]: awesome
short_description [A simple plugin to use with pytest]:
version [0.1.0]:
pytest_version [2.9.1]:
Select docs_tool:
1 - mkdocs
2 - sphinx
3 - none
Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 1
Select license:
1 - MIT
2 - BSD-3
3 - GNU GPL v3.0
Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 2
INFO:post_gen_project:Moving files for mkdocs.
```

There you go - you just created a minimal pytest plugin:

```no-highlight
pytest-awesome/
├── LICENSE
├── README.rst
├── docs
│   └── index.md
├── mkdocs.yml
├── setup.py
├── src
│   └── pytest_awesome
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── plugin.py
├── tests
│   ├── conftest.py
│   └── test_awesome.py
└── tox.ini
```


## Features

- Installable [PyPI] package featuring a `setup.py`.
- Test suite running [tox] and [pytest] that makes sure your plugin is working
  as expected
- Working example code for a fixture, a cli option, as well as a pytest.ini
  option
- Comprehensive `README.rst` file that contains useful information about your
  plugin
- Continuous integration configuration for [Travis CI] and [AppVeyor]
- Optional documentation with either [Sphinx] or [MkDocs]
- Choose from several licenses, such as [MIT], [BSD-3], [Apache v2.0], [GNU GPL
  v3.0], or [MPL v2.0]

## Requirements to Submit a Plugin

If you plan on submitting your plugin to the [pytest-dev organization] you need
to meet the following requirements:

-   PyPI presence with a setup.py that contains a license, pytest-
    prefixed, version number, authors, short and long description.
-   a tox.ini for running tests using tox.
-   a README describing how to use the plugin and on which platforms
    it runs.
-   a LICENSE file or equivalent containing the licensing information,
    with matching info in setup.py.
-   an issue tracker unless you rather want to use the core pytest
    issue tracker.

Please see the official guidelines at [Submit a Plugin].
